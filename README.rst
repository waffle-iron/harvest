Harvest

Automation Done Right.  Harvest gathers all the tooling you need to create, test, and deploy your code.

Overview
========

If you're tired of using in-house tools for testing and development that never seem to work together, this is for you.

Harvest is all about productive coding - achieved by being highly automatable by design.  This framework provides a CLI which can wrap the tools that you use every day.
